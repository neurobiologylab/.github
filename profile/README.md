# NBI Lab

Welcome to NBI (Neurobiology and Biophysics Interface) lab Github account!

## Our Missions
 - Scientific Discoveries
 
We are studying the fundamental scientific principles at the interfaces of biological and material systems. 

Curiosity has the boundless power to drive scientific discoveries. We acquire inspiration from biophysics, material science and engineering, electronics and neurobiology and investigate the phenomena of magnetism, electricity, chemistry and optics between the material and nervous systems. These fundamental principles can further guide us to effective engineering designs for biomedical applications.

 - Biotechnology Advancement
 
We are developing effective engineering methodologies to investigate neurobiological questions. 

Biotechnology advancement is an indispensable catalyst for addressing neurobiological questions. Targeting specific technological challenges in neurobiology, we synthesize and fabricate functional materials, from nanoscale materials to devices, and apply them as engineering tools with various modalities to study the neural mechanisms underlying neurological and psychiatric disorders, including depression, addiction and social deficits.
